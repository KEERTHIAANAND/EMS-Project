# EMS Max Seats & Completed Status Features - IMPLEMENTED! âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Added Features

Your EMS system now includes **max seats functionality** and **completed status display in green** as requested!

## âœ… Backend Features Implemented

### **1. Max Seats Functionality**
- **Max Seats Field**: Added to Event model (MongoDB and fallback)
- **Available Seats Calculation**: `available_seats = max_seats - rsvp_count`
- **Capacity Management**: Events can have seat limits (default: 50 seats)
- **Full Event Detection**: Events marked as "full" when no seats available

### **2. Completed Status System**
- **Automatic Detection**: Events marked as "completed" when date has passed
- **Status Calculation**: Three statuses - "open", "full", "completed"
- **Date Comparison**: Uses event date vs current date
- **Real-time Updates**: Status calculated dynamically

### **3. Enhanced Event Model**
```python
# New fields added:
max_seats = IntField(default=50)  # Maximum seats available
status = calculated  # "open", "full", "completed"
is_completed = calculated  # True/False based on date
available_seats = calculated  # max_seats - rsvp_count
```

### **4. API Response Enhancement**
Events now return:
```json
{
  "max_seats": 25,
  "rsvp_count": 5,
  "available_seats": 20,
  "status": "open",
  "is_completed": false
}
```
